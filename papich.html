<h3 id="observation--interview">Observation &amp; Interview</h3>
<p>Participants (all the names are made up) :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ms. Kim</strong> - a graduate international student who has good background in Korean language, as she had 1 year of korean course before graduate school. Interviewed by Assem and observed by Aitolkyn. In her university she is the only representative from her country. Interestingly, at first she tried to initiate conversation with a young local student but failed. Eventually, she tried to talk to local university staff, and it was noticed that elder local was very friendly and interested in conversation. Notably, they started conversation by talking about their mutual friend. She pointed out that knowing local language did not guarantee to become closer friends with locals. Interesting points are that she could approach a local representative by buddy program where they met and mostly discussed K-pop, as a same interest topic.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Robert</strong> - korean student, junior of physics department, male. Interviewed by Bauyrzhan. He was asked to have a conversation with an international freshman student. Robert was struggling to find a topic to talk about, however, had no struggles to keep up the conversation when his companion came up with a topic. After conversation, he shared his thoughts during it and he said that he was trying really hard to be cohesive and not to make any grammar/pronunciation mistakes.<em>(for the moment of an interview, he was thought to be our target user, but in fact, he is not)</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Ms. Nam</strong> - international KAIST student, the only undergraduate from her country. Interviewed by Assem and Aitolkyn. What is unique about this participant is that she is a native English speaker and often feels awkwardness of locals when speaking to her, which motivates her to study Korean. It was noticed that she is an active participant of social student life, a member of several clubs and a lab, as she had to become more social after coming to Korea. An interesting experience of her interaction with locals occurred when local female students from her department approached her first and suggested to do HWs together. She thinks that since females are minority in their department, they tried to support her.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Ms. Lee</strong> - international sophomore student, female. Ms. Lee - international sophomore student at KAIST having a comparatively small community in the university (around 10 students). Interviewed by Aitolkyn and observed by Assem. Ms. Lee was asked to initiate a conversation with a local student. Interesting observation was that even though they are from different departments and cultures, they could easily discuss on a specific topic related to the research of the local student. At the beginning the local student was not very responsive, probably because he was distracted from his work and did not talk too much. But it was noted that Ms. Lee constantly tried to express her interest and ask questions which led to more detailed discussions from him. Eventually the local student was engaged much greater and explained his project by using gestures and showing pictures.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Ms. Park</strong> - international sophomore student, who befriended both locals and internationals, female. Our case of an extreme user. Interviewed by Miras. She was asked about her experience in befriending locals. Park mentioned that being somewhat knowledgeable in korean language played a big role in it, however, some of her buddies befriended her before she learned Korean. She also said that all of her local friends are from high school, as because of studies, she had no time to look for new acquaintances in the university itself.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Our extreme users:</strong> Ms. Kim and Ms. Nam, they are the only representatives of their country at a university.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How we recruited for the interview:</strong> at first we were targeting both locals and internationals seeking for communication, however, given the feedback of the studio session, we decided to narrow it down to internationals with small country communities within a university (15 or less representatives, to be precise).</p>
